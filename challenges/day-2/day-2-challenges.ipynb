Since `__add__` is always called on the **left** operand, `5 + DualNumber(2,1)` will fail as `int` doesn't know how to add a `DualNumber`. In the case of failure, python with try to call the `__radd__` method on the **right** operand. Your tasks are :\n",
    "   * allow for adding `int` and `float` to a `DualNumber`\n",
    "      * make sure that `__add__(self, other)` works when `other` is a `DualNumber`, `float`, or `int` and define a method `__radd__(self, other)` to just return `self + other`.\n",
    "   * allow for subtracting a `DualNumber` from `int` and `float` (you'll need to define `__rsub__` and `__rneg__`)\n",
    "   * allow for multiplying a `DualNumber` by `int` and `float` (you'll need to define `__rmul__`)\n",
    "   * allow for `/` with `int` and `float` (you'll need to define `__rtruediv__`)\n",
    "\n",
    "   At the end, calls like `5 + DualNumber(2,1)`, `5.4*DualNumber(2,1)`, and `1.2/DualNumber(2.7,1)` should all work.\n",

    "   \n",
    "* **c.** define a global function `derivative(f, a)`, which takes a`f(x)` defined with only the `+,-,*,/,` and `**` operations performed on `y`, and returns `f'(a)`.\n",
    "   * for example, let\n",
    "   ```python\n",
