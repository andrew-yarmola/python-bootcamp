    "## Software and Setup \n",
    "\n",
    "### Installing\n",
    "\n",
    "You have several options for installing Python. In my order of preference:\n",
    "1. If you are already using homebrew : \n",
    " \n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    brew install python\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    \n",
    "Alternatively, you can\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Download from [python.org](https://www.python.org)\n",
    "3. For scientific computing, many use the Anaconda distribution from [continuum.io/downloads](https://www.continuum.io/downloads)\n",
    "\n",
    "__Remark__ If you are willing to trade some package compatibility (especially C extension reliant packages such as pandas and scikit-learn) for speed and micro threading, you can try PyPy from [pypy.org](http://pypy.org)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Managing the Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the benefits of using python is the enormous library of software packages and modules ready for you to use. Because of the interdependencies between all of these packages, you will need package manager (or maybe a collection of package managers). Since you will also be working with a production environment, I strongly encourage the use of __virtual environments__. Virtual environments let you develop and test against a fixed collection dependencies, which you can share withing a repository. Further, they allow you to isolate dependencies between different projects or parts of your application.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Obligatory XKCD](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/python_environment.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "All distributions of python 3 come with a default package manger called `pip`. This package manager is good for setting up your own working environment but not for sharing, distributing, or collaboratively working on projects. I would recommend:\n",
    "1. A new and popular player on the block called `pipenv`\n",
    "    * markets itself as a workflow tool for development and dependency management.\n",
    "    * both a python package manager and a virtual environment manager\n",
    "    * built-in module security checks and hashing to help keep environments consistent\n",
    "    * uses `pyenv` to install versions of python as needed\n",
    "    * does __not__ package and distribute your code for you (you still have to manage your own `setup.py`)\n",
    "    * homebrew install via : `brew install pipenv`\n",
    "    \n",
    "    In addition, I encourage you run `brew install pyenv` and `export PYENV_ROOT=...` as appropriate. This utility allows you (and `pipenv`) to easily manage many different python versions on your system, which is useful for freezing a python version for development with `pipenv`.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    A good overview of how `pyenv` and `pipenv` work can be found at [gioele.io/pyenv-pipenv](https://gioele.io/pyenv-pipenv)\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. There are other new and old contenders to consider:\n",
    "    * `pip` + `venv` or `pip` + `vitualenv` + `virtualenvwrapper`\n",
    "        * lower level, but more versatile and flexible\n",
    "        * less secure and has fewer guarantees to keep production consistent\n",
    "    * `poetry` at [poetry.eustace.io](https://poetry.eustace.io)\n",
    "        * another contender for the \"standard\" secure and hashed package management tool for python\n",
    "        * somewhat faster than `pipenv`, and has **package distribution tools built-in**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. If you decided to use Anaconda, it comes with it's own package manager called `conda`\n",
    "    * as with `pipenv`, this is both a package manager and a virtual environment manager\n",
    "    * it does not help you distribute/package your code\n",
    "    * can manage many non-python binaries and extensions used for scientific computing        \n",
    "        \n",

This causes some difficulty with multi-threading, but modern libraries make it relatively simple to implement multi-threaded workloads. \n",
