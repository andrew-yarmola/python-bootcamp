    "Flask is a lightweight web application framework that wraps the Werkzeug web application library and uses Jinja for it's template engine.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Flask documentation is rather extensive and we will essentially go through the tutorial at [flask.palletsprojects.com](https://flask.palletsprojects.com) and some others.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Werkzeug\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Werkzeug is a comprehensive WSGI web application library. WSGI stands for Web Server Gateway Interface. It implements a specification that describes how a web server communicates with web applications, such as Flask app written in python. \n",
    "\n",
    "Flask wraps Werkzeug, using it to handle the details of WSGI while providing more structure and patterns for defining powerful applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Werkzeug includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "* An interactive debugger that allows inspecting stack traces and source code in the browser with an interactive interpreter for any frame in the stack.\n",
    "* A full-featured request object with objects to interact with headers, query args, form data, files, and cookies.\n",
    "* A response object that can wrap other WSGI applications and handle streaming data.\n",
    "* A routing system for matching URLs to endpoints and generating URLs for endpoints, with an extensible system for capturing variables from URLs.\n",
    "* HTTP utilities to handle entity tags, cache control, dates, user agents, cookies, files, and more.\n",
    "* A threaded WSGI server for use while developing applications locally.\n",
    "* A test client for simulating HTTP requests during testing without requiring running a server.\n",
    "Werkzeug is Unicode aware and doesn't enforce any dependencies. It is up to the developer to choose a template engine, database adapter, and even how to handle requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Jinja\n",
    "\n",
    "Jinja2 is a full-featured template engine for Python with full unicode support. A template engine is a system for dynamically generating HTML and other web formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is what templates look like.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "{% extends \"layout.html\" %}\n",
    "{% block body %}\n",
    "  <ul>\n",
    "  {% for user in users %}\n",
    "    <li><a href=\"{{ user.url }}\">{{ user.username }}</a></li>\n",
    "  {% endfor %}\n",
    "  </ul>\n",
    "{% endblock %}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* Sandboxed execution mode. Every aspect of the template execution is monitored and explicitly whitelisted or blacklisted, whatever is preferred. This makes it possible to execute untrusted templates.\n",
    "* powerful automatic HTML escaping system for cross site scripting prevention.\n",
    "* Template inheritance makes it possible to use the same or a similar layout for all templates.\n",
    "* High performance with just in time compilation to Python bytecode. Jinja2 will translate your template sources on first load into Python bytecode for best runtime performance.\n",
    "* Optional ahead-of-time compilation\n",
    "* Easy to debug with a debug system that integrates template compile and runtime errors into the standard Python traceback system.\n",
    "* Configurable syntax. For instance you can reconfigure Jinja2 to better fit output formats such as LaTeX or JavaScript.\n",
    "* Template designer helpers. Jinja2 ships with a wide range of useful little helpers that help solving common tasks in templates such as breaking up sequences of items into multiple columns and more."
